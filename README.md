![Tic Tac Toe Banner](./New%20folder/Screenshot%202025-09-01%20121404.png)

A fun and interactive **Tic Tac Toe game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was created as part of my practice in frontend web development and game logic.

---

## 📌 About the Project

- Classic **two-player game** (Player X vs Player O).
- Showcases the use of **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **game state tracking**.
- Perfect beginner project to practice **logic building** and **interactive UI design**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🟢 Two-player gameplay (X and O take turns).
- 🟢 Winning detection (rows, columns, diagonals).
- 🟢 Draw detection when the grid is full.
- 🟢 Reset button to start a new game.
- 🟢 Simple and responsive UI design.

---

## 🧩 Why It’s Important

- Helps understand **game logic development**.
- Practices **JavaScript functions, conditions, and event listeners**.
- Builds confidence in **DOM manipulation** and handling user interactions.

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

Tic Tac Toe may be a simple game, but it teaches important concepts like **strategy, planning ahead, and anticipating moves**.  
In real life, this is similar to:

- Business strategy planning.
- Sports tactics (anticipating opponent’s move).
- Everyday decision-making.
